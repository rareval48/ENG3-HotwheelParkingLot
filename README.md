### Evidence and Wiring
No wiring needed as I used onboard LED

### Reflection
The first thing that I had to do was see what was happened to the Metro becasue the serial monitor kept printing "Hello World" even though I had "Make Colors" with the print funtion. I had to reset the board everytime i updated my code to fix the problem. Once it was fixed the assignment got significantly easier.
