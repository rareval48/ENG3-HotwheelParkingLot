## Planning

### The Plan

### Description
I have worked out the planning for the hardest to go first so I can work the code around the CAD and not the other way around. If there are major flaws in the CAD, I can always go back and fix them by re cutting or printing them. So far I am following the plan accordingly and there havent been any problems.

## Research

### Ideas and Solutions
So far there have been a couple ideas on how to move the arm (displayed below). I have used some of the little details to make my arm easier to make and easier to put together with the limited supplies I have. One problem with designing the arm is moving the arm up and down, there are many ways you can move it up and down but there are only a couple that will work with the small space that is available. One of my ideas for moving the the arm up and down is using a servo at the top and spinning it so the arm can go up and down like a bucket in a well. The other idea to get this to work is to make a small pulley system for a string/rope to pull the arm.

### Problems With Ideas
I have tried to make the first idea where I move the arm up and down like a bucket but the arm wouldnt be able to have a full range of motion wile keeping the strings out of the way. The other problem I have with this idea is the amount of space it takes up. So I will be trying the other idea where I use a pulley system and seeign if there is any way I can improve it to make it more compact and efficient.
